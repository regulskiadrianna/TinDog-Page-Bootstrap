The TinDog page is created by me. The resources used for the website come from the Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp found on Udemy. 

By completing the website I have learned the following:
-Ways to use bootstrap in my code
-Applying bootstrap buttons, containers, carousel, cards, and much more

-Refactoring the code to save space and limit repetition
